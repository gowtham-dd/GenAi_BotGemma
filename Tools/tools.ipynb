      "Purpose This study aims to analyse the factors influencing students' behavioural intention to adopt AI research tools using a logistic regression model. Study Design / Methodology / Approach A structured survey was conducted among 350 college students in Coimbatore, aged 18-25. The survey assessed factors such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, perceived trust, and facilitating conditions. Data were analysed using logistic regression modelling techniques. Findings The study found that perceived usefulness and facilitating conditions significantly influence students' behavioural intention to adopt AI research tools. The logistic regression model predicted students' propensity to use AI tools with an accuracy rate of 80.43%. Originality / Value This research addresses a notable gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing students' adoption of AI research tools, offering valuable insights for educators, researchers, and policymakers.\n",

      "\n",
      "_This research investigates the contribution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards knowledge sharing, staff motivation, and ethical issues in higher education collaboration among university academics (N = 290). Correlation analysis indicated a moderate to weak positive correlation between AI and knowledge sharing (r = 0.213, p = 0.000) and AI and staff motivation (r = 0.298, p = 0.000), indicating that AI contributes to greater involvement and knowledge sharing. Still, regression analysis indicated that the influence of AI on academic productivity was statistically non-significant (R² = 0.000, p = 0.970), implying that AI, by itself, does not impact faculty motivation much. Also pointed out were the ethical issues related to data privacy, bias of AI, and intellectual property concerns, supporting the importance of having institutional policies and ethical frameworks in place for adopting AI in academic environments. These conclusions indicate that although AI is a useful tool for cooperation and productivity, its applications are limited without adequate faculty training and policy structures. Future studies must investigate longitudinal studies and qualitative analyses to determine the long-term effect of AI on academic quality._\n",

So, the Proposed model will be manufactured using 3 D printing system considering the suggestions of Healthcare people in developing a Stopgap Face Mask and the model will be manufactured in different sizes and shapes to suit the facial structure of Indians. The SFM is comprised of the 3 D printed mask and filter cover, two elastic strips, and a rectangular patch of filter material and also the filter in center coated with nanoparticles of Ag and Titanium Dioxide. By using this technique possible to produce respirators at a low cost and the used nano-particles has the efficiency to kill viruses, so the lifetime of the filter is much higher than the conventionally available respirators.

      "La Fondation Dassault Systemes has been a great supporter of our project “Design and Development of Fruits and Vegetables Quality Detector Using IOT Technology”. The food processing industry is one of the largest industries in India and it is a burgeoning sector that has achieved elevation in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The individuality of the fruits and vegetables is only appreciated in terms of their freshness. To intensify the quality of the fruits and vegetables the so-called manufacturers enumerate them with unwanted items like pesticides, flavoring agents which cause diseases like cancer, etc., The consumers who are buying should get to know whether the selected fruits and vegetables are safe to consume. Hence this problem can be technologically addressed through a mobile application that determines the freshness of fruits and vegetables. The chemical substances present in fruits and vegetables are determined using sensor-enabled IoT technology. This will help to increase the digitalization process in India and it will be as great benevolence for the customers as it is done non-destructively. The Investigators of this project are Dr.R.Kanmani, Associate Professor, Ms.S.Muthulakshmi, Assistant Professor, Dr. A.Christy Jeba Malar, Associate Professor, Department of Information Technology along with Mr.B.Mukund Sanjay, Mr.S.S.Sanjiv, and Mr.S.Vikkash,III year (Batch 2019-2023) students of Department of Information Technology.\n",

      "\n",
      "Through the support of the Là Foundation Dassault Systèmes, we are carrying out a project to improve the quality of education of underprivileged students. The goal of the project is to impart a strong background in science and maths to students through an experimental learning process. Additionally, the medium of delivery is a key differentiator for our project as it is done through Virtual Reality where students perform experiments virtually, the project is easily scalable and replicable at various schools and universities around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In India only 28,300 of 67,400 students (42%) get into technical jobs after their education. This is very much closely related to the lack of practical experience and weak understanding of fundamentals in engineering. If students are industry ready during graduation, there will be a significant rise in the placement ratios of the institution. Currently a student gains practical experience only through internships, industrial visits or a separate training; these processes are very time-consuming and expensive as all the students cannot afford such opportunities. Thus, producing the applications of engineering that can only be found in an industry through VR experimental kits, students will be able to undergo hands-on learning experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "This method of learning will drastically improve the student’s way of understanding the fundamentals of science, mathematics concepts and applications in engineering around them. Hence, we strive to build a strong foundation with quality education to bring out the full potential of a student.\n",
      "\n",
      "We aim on enabling engineering graduates to seek quality education by making them understand the fundamentals of engineering by providing an experiential learning experience. This results in the strengthening of the student’s understanding of fundamental concepts in math and science. Additionally, we aim to impart education with a practical demonstration using experimental kits and make the students experience science and mathematics, applications of engineering through VR. Through these steps, we focus to change the way a student perceives science and math around them in the future.\n",

      "We are grateful to La Fondation Dassault Systemes for supporting the project on the Development of an Autonomous Vehicle for Subsea Oil Pipeline Inspection and Cleaning Oil Spills. The autonomous vehicle detects the defects in the oil pipeline using deep learning technology with the help of an RGB camera at a subsea level of 300ft. This autonomous vehicle is a highly efficient oil spill cleaning that automatically locates and maneuvers to oil spill areas.\n",

      "A reconfigurable robot that can be powered with photovoltaic cells and can be tracked using a GPS module that feeds the data to the dedicated application created. This vehicle is divided into two vehicles based on their applications. One is a remotely operated upper surface vehicle for cleaning oil spills in the ocean. And the other is an underwater vehicle that could be deployed for inspection of oil pipelines subsea. The oil collecting mechanism in the upper surface vehicle involves an inclined conveyor belt surfaced with material that is oleophilic and hydrophobic in nature. The oil is absorbed by the conveyor belt and gets collected inside the oil storage tank present in the vehicle. This oil-collecting mechanism works on solar energy.

The food processing industry is one of the largest industries in India and it is a burgeoning sector that has achieved elevation in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The individuality of the fruits and vegetables is only appreciated in terms of their freshness. To intensify the quality of the fruits and vegetables the so-called manufacturers enumerate them with unwanted items like pesticides, flavoring agents which cause diseases like cancer, etc., The consumers who are buying should get to know whether the selected fruits and vegetables are safe to consume. Hence this problem can be technologically addressed through a mobile application that determines the freshness of fruits and vegetables. The chemical substances present in fruits and vegetables are determined using sensor-enabled IoT technology. This will help to increase the digitalization process in India and it will be as great benevolence for the customers as it is done non-destructively.

      "Through the support of the Là Foundation Dassault Systèmes, we are carrying out a project to improve the quality of education of underprivileged students. The goal of the project is to impart a strong background in science and maths to students through an experimental learning process. Additionally, the medium of delivery is a key differentiator for our project as it is done through Virtual Reality where students perform experiments virtually, the project is easily scalable and replicable at various schools and universities around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In India only 28,300 of 67,400 students (42%) get into technical jobs after their education. This is very much closely related to the lack of practical experience and weak understanding of fundamentals in engineering. If students are industry ready during graduation, there will be a significant rise in the placement ratios of the institution. Currently a student gains practical experience only through internships, industrial visits or a separate training; these processes are very time-consuming and expensive as all the students cannot afford such opportunities. Thus, producing the applications of engineering that can only be found in an industry through VR experimental kits, students will be able to undergo hands-on learning experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "This method of learning will drastically improve the student’s way of understanding the fundamentals of science, mathematics concepts and applications in engineering around them. Hence, we strive to build a strong foundation with quality education to bring out the full potential of a student.\n",
      "\n",
      "We aim on enabling engineering graduates to seek quality education by making them understand the fundamentals of engineering by providing an experiential learning experience. This results in the strengthening of the student’s understanding of fundamental concepts in math and science. Additionally, we aim to impart education with a practical demonstration using experimental kits and make the students experience science and mathematics, applications of engineering through VR. Through these steps, we focus to change the way a student perceives science and math around them in the future.\n",

      "The integration of AI-powered tools, particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) apps, in assessing and providing feedback on oral proficiency has gained significant attention lately. This comparative study analyzes Chat-GPT 4o and ELSA Speech Analyzer AI delayed feedback in comparison with feedback provided by three pre-service teachers on a student’s IELTS speaking performance. The research employed a quantitative design with a total of 27 sets of feedback from the three sources. The data were analyzed according to the five criteria adapted from the feedback framework of Steiss et al. (2024). All feedback was found to be positive and adhere to IELTS speaking band descriptors. Nevertheless, Chat-GPT’s focus was only on grammatical and vocabulary errors, missing the aspects related to pronunciation. The tool did not identify audio input as human speech and, instead, provided corrections based on assumptions only. ELSA gave elaborate details in feedback regarding pronunciation which might be too much information for some learners. Pre-service teachers provided holistic feedback but lacked specific analysis of clear directions for improvement. Besides, the teachers-to-be provided inaccurate pronunciation corrections at times. These insights emphasize the importance of integrating AI and human interaction when learning a language. From an educational standpoint, this method covers the structural and personal technical requirements of each individual student, resulting in a more interactive and positive atmosphere.\n",

      "Recently, efforts have been intensified in Nigerian universities to address errors and ethical issues in scholarly communications. However, despite significant efforts by the government and university administrators to resolve these challenges, most researchers still lack the expertise to effectively utilize advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools that are essential for producing ethically sound and error-free scholarly articles. AI has speedily emerged as one of the most significant and transformative innovations of our time, with wide-ranging applications in almost every field of knowledge. Among these applications, research has arguably witnessed the fastest growth and adoption of AI-driven tools in developed nations. This study provides an in-depth review of the present applications of AI-driven tools in higher education in Nigeria, with a focus on universities, and explores the factors affecting innovative research output in universities in Nigeria. The findings from the articles reveal that several factors contribute to this, such as poor research sponsorship, limited access to online scholarly articles, unethical practices, unintentional errors, and brain drain. Benefits, implications, and strategies for improvement, along with a roadmap outlining the way forward, are suggested.\n",

      "This systematic review provides unique findings with an up-to-date examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) from 2016 to 2022. Using PRISMA principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a full examination. Using a priori, and grounded coding, the data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022, publications rose nearly two to three times the number of previous years. With this rapid rise in the number of AIEd HE publications, new trends have emerged. The findings show that research was conducted in six of the seven continents of the world. The trend has shifted from the US to China leading in the number of publications. Another new trend is in the researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of researchers from departments of education. This has now changed to be the most dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most studied students at 72%. Similar to the findings of other studies, language learning was the most common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the AIEd was intended for 72% of the studies focused on students, 17% instructors, and 11% managers. In answering the overarching question of how AIEd was used in HE, grounded coding was used. Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) AI Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Managing Student Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature to be used as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools, such as Chat GPT.\n",

      "The advancement of artificial intelligence in education (AIED) has the potential to transform the educational landscape and influence the role of all involved stake-holders. In recent years, the applications of AIED have been gradually adopted to progress our understanding of students' learning and enhance learning performance and experience. However, the adoption of AIED has led to increasing ethical risks and concerns regarding several aspects such as personal data and learner autonomy. Despite the recent announcement of guidelines for ethical and trustworthy AIED, the debate revolves around the key principles underpinning ethical AIED. This paper aims to explore whether there is a global consensus on ethical AIED by mapping and analyzing international organizations' current policies and guidelines. In this paper, we first introduce the opportunities offered by AI in education and potential ethical issues. Then, thematic analysis was conducted to conceptualize and establish a set of ethical principles by examining and synthesizing relevant ethical policies and guidelines for AIED. We discuss each principle and associated implications for relevant educational stakeholders, including students, teachers, technology developers, policymakers, and institutional decision-makers. The proposed set of ethical principles is expected to serve as a framework to inform and guide educational stakeholders in the development and deployment of ethical and trustworthy AIED as well as catalyze future development of related impact studies in the field.\n",

      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is seeping into many aspects of our everyday lives, with common internet applications, smartphones and even household appliances. Within education, AI is a rapidly emerging field and there is a strong potential for AI to greatly extend and enhance teaching and learning in higher education (Crompton et al., 2020). AI is defined as “computing systems that are able to engage in human-like processes such as learning, adapting, synthesizing, self-correction and use of data for complex processing tasks” (Popenici & Kerr, 2017). In the Horizon Report 2020 report (Brown et al., 2020), AI is listed as one of six technologies with the potential for high impact in higher education. The Horizon Report (2020), is an annual publication that examines the major trends in educational technology that are shaping global higher education. This paper will highlight some of the ways AI is supporting both students and faculty members including bespoke learning, intelligent tutoring systems, facilitating collaboration, and automated grading.

      "The term “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence on a computer. Higher education can benefit from AI because it is a computationally efficient paradigm. Learning adapted to the changing demands of students is one of the key educational advantages of AI. Students can modify the pace of a course to better competency. Poor faculty and teaching quality and a general lack of motivation and interest among students are among the difficulties facing higher education. An artificial intelligence-assisted integrated teaching–learning framework (AL-ITLF) for higher education is proposed in this research. Multiple tutoring services are also involved in the curriculum, which is skill-based. The extreme learning machine (ELM) technique evaluates designs integrated into the suitable student monitoring model weighted score (WS) and exam results. An educational model that is more efficient, adaptable, and effective than current traditional education has been developed due to AI research in higher education. Higher education’s use of AI has resulted in a more efficient, adaptive, and effective educational model than traditional schooling. High accuracy, higher performance, lower processing costs, and a high prediction and low error rate are advantages of the suggested AI-ITLF approach. The WS and exam results were evaluated using an ELM algorithm as part of a proper student monitoring model.\n",

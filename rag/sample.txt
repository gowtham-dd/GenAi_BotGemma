I am not on trial for being a dwarf. Oh yes I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life. Have you nothing to say in your defense? Nothing but this: I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had. Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores. I wish I was the monster you think I am! I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you! I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it
